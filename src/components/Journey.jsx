        "It's been quite an exciting year! While studying at uni and working, I developed core dealer-broker systems and successfully organized annual general meetings online for around 10 companies including Khan Bank. I was fortunate to win the FIBO Cloud scholarship among 200+ students, and separately, completed a one-month internship in Japan at Academic Express, where I worked entirely in Japanese! On the side, I've been working with friends on various business projects. It's been challenging balancing everything, but I'm loving every moment of growth and learning.",
